                <h2>Sea of Shadows<br>By Kelley Armstrong</h2>
                <p>In this dark fantasy trilogy opener by a #1 New York Times–bestselling author,<br> 
                    twin sisters prepare to fight shadows to save their empire.<br>
                    In the Forest of the Dead, where the empire’s worst criminals are exiled,<br> 
                    twin sisters Moria and Ashyn are charged with a dangerous task. 
                    For they are the Keeper and the Seeker, and each year they must quiet the enraged souls of the damned. 
                    Only this year, the souls will not be quieted.</p>

                        <p>Ashyn <br>
                        <br>
                            One <br>
                            <br> 
                            Ashyn sat by the fire, eating pork rolls while feeding meat scraps to 
                            Tova, the giant yellow hound that never left her side. She gazed out 
                            the window and watched the spring sun burn away the lace of frost.<br><br> 
                            Her twin sister, Moria, sauntered in, late for breakfast as always. 
                            Moria’s wildcat, Daigo, appeared out of nowhere and snatched a 
                            scrap from under Tova’s nose. <br><br>
                            Ashyn sighed and Tova sighed, too. Then they just helped them- 
                            selves to more food and moved over to let Moria and Daigo sit with 
                            them.<br><br> 
                            “Finally. I lost it before the first snow fell.” 
                            “Then perhaps, in future, you ought to be more careful with your 
                            belongings.” <br><br>
                            “I can’t help it. I’m forgetful.”
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page" id="page2">
                        <p>Father shook his head. “You’ve never forgotten anything in your 
                            life, Rya. Who got your blade this time? Another woman needing pro- 
                            tection from her husband?” <br><br>
                            “That would be wrong. Blades are for warriors. Ash and I are the 
                            only exceptions.” She took a bite of her pork. “But if I did give it to 
                            some poor soul in need, it would be the spirits’ fault. They speak, and 
                            I must obey.” <br><br>
                            Their father shared an eye roll with Ashyn. While it was true that the 
                            girls served the ancestral spirits, it was an excuse Moria used too 
                            often.<br><br> 
                            “Waiting so long for weapons isn’t reasonable,” Moria continued. 
                            “We need a smith. I’m sure there’s a strong young man who could 
                            take up the task, for the greater good.” She chewed. “How about that 
                            Kitsune boy?” 
                            “What’s Gavril done now that you’re volunteering him for 
                            smithing?” Ashyn asked.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="page-pair" id="pair2">
                    <div class="page" id="page3">
                        <p>“Then his ancestors have forgotten him, because he isn’t very good 
                            at it.” <br><br> 
                            Ashyn shook her head. 
                            “Since I won’t have my dagger by morning, I’ll need a knife,” Moria 
                            said, her voice deceptively casual. “I’m going lizard hunting.” 
                            “Are you?” Father mused. “Perhaps I’ll come along.” 
                            “You scare the lizards.”<br><br>  
                            “No,” he said. “I’ll scare you—away from the forest. Which is where 
                            you truly plan to go.” <br><br> 
                            Moria made a face. “Why would I want to go into the forest?” 
                            Neither Ashyn nor their father replied to that. They both knew what 
                            Moria had in mind. Tomorrow was the Seeking. Ashyn was the Seeker. 
                            Having passed her sixteenth summer, she would enter the Forest of 
                            the Dead for the first time, where she would find the bodies of the 
                            damned and put their spirits to rest. <br><br> 
                            “I don’t see why I can’t go,” Moria continued when no one an- 
                            swered. “I’m the Keeper. I protect the empire from unsettled spirits, 
                            so it should be my duty to help with the Seeking.”</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="page-pair" id="pair3">
                    <div class="page" id="page5">
                        <p>don’t need my little sister to protect me.”<br> 
                            Moria grumbled. Ashyn knew she hated the reminder that she’d 
                            been born a half day later. Twins were so rare that their mother had 
                            gone that long before realizing the ongoing labor pains weren’t merely 
                            the aftereffects of Ashyn’s birth. <br><br> 
                            “I’m trained with a blade,” Ashyn continued evenly. “Besides, I have 
                            Tova. He wouldn’t let anything happen to me.” <br><br> 
                            On cue, the hound laid his head on her knee. 
                            “I still don’t like it,” Moria said. <br>
                            Ashyn leaned against her twin. “I know.”<br><br>  
                             
                            Tomorrow Ashyn would conduct the Seeking—her primary role as 
                            Seeker of Edgewood. There were four pairs of Seekers and Keepers in 
                            the empire. Two traveled where they were needed, and one stayed at 
                            court. The last pair was permanently stationed at the most spiritually 
                            dangerous place in the empire—Edgewood—where they guarded the 
                            only break in the box-canyon wall that surrounded the Forest of the 
                            Dead.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page" id="page6">
                        <p>Their forest had always been thick with spiritual energy,<br> from the 
                            old practice of elder abandonment. After that ended, the empire began 
                            exiling its criminals here, <br>and the ancestral spirits had fled to the
                            village at its mouth. That was what made Edgewood so dangerous 
                            that it needed its own Keeper and Seeker. <br>The village was filled with 
                            ancestral spirits in constant need of appeasement, and the forest was 
                            filled with angry spirits in constant need of restraint. <br>
                            Before the Seeking, there was a full day of rituals to be conducted. 
                            As they followed the rocky lane to the sanctuary, Ashyn looked at her 
                            twin sister. Two of the village children walked backward in front of 
                            Moria. A half dozen more followed behind her.<br> The children were not 
                            coming along for the ritual, of course, but merely tagging along after 
                            Moria.
                            
                            </p>

                        <p>Daigo would growl. They’d dance away, grinning, only to come right 
                            back, chattering like Healer Mabill’s pet magpie. Tell us a story, Moria. 
                            Show us a trick. Teach us something.<br><br>   
                            Moria would scowl at the younger children and lob insults at the 
                            older ones. They still adored her, <br> still followed her through the village 
                            like stray dogs, knowing a scrap would eventually come. They’d get a 
                            story or they’d get a trick or they’d get a lesson,<br>  and they’d get smiles, 
                            too, and kind words, if they earned them. <br> <br> 
                            “Better run home,” Moria called as they continued down the lane.<br>  
                            “You know what happens if you get too close to the sanctuary and see</p>

                            “Our eyes will pop!” a boy shouted.<br> 
                            “Yes. They’ll explode like dried corn in a fire, and you’ll be left with 
                            holes in your head for your brains to leak out.” <br>
                            “Eww!” one of the girls said. “And then what?”<br> 
                            “Then you’ll be walking around with only half your wits, drooling 
                            and gaping.” She pointed at the oldest boy. “In other words, you’ll end 
                            up just like Niles over there.”
                            The children giggled. <br><br>
                            Moria continued, “If you behave yourselves and stay away from the 
                            sanctuary, I might tell some stories tonight. But you must stay away. 
                            Ashyn needs complete silence outside or she’ll forget the words to all 
                            the chants.” She lowered her voice to a mock whisper. “I think she 
                            might have gotten too close to a ritual when she was little.”</p>

                        <p>Ashyn made a face at her. Moria tossed back a grin. Despite the in- 
                            sult, Ashyn knew Moria was doing her a favor—a quiet sanctuary 
                            would indeed help today. It was the first time she’d conduct the Seek- 
                            ing rituals alone. <br><br>
                            “Now, what kind of creature do you want for tonight’s story?” 
                            Moria asked. “Thunder hawks? Sand dragons? Water horses?”<br><br>
                            As the children called out suggestions, a small voice whispered be- 
                            side Ashyn. “Are you scared?”<br><br> 
                            She looked down at the girl, walking so close Tova had to give her 
                            room. There were always a couple frightened by Moria’s stories and 
                            scowls. This one was Wenda, just past her ninth summer. Ashyn 
                            stroked the girl’s black curls.

                    <div class="page" id="page10">
                        <p>“I’ve assisted with the rituals many times,” Ashyn said. “It’s not 
                            frightening.” <br>
                            “I mean the Seeking. Finding the”—Wenda shuddered—“bodies. 
                            And the spirits. Momma says when the damned die, they become the 
                            forsaken and can hurt us.” She looked up, dark eyes glistening. “They 
                            can hurt you.” <br><br> 
                            “But they won’t. I’m there to calm them and make sure they are 
                            buried properly. That takes away their anger. They’ll go to the second 
                            world and be happy.” <br><br> 
                            Moria glanced over, her rough voice softening. “Ashyn’s been train- 
                            ing for this since she was smaller than you. She’s ready.” 
                            Ashyn wished she shared her sister’s confidence. It was true they’d 
                            been training most of their lives.</p>
