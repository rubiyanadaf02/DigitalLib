                <h2>The Chaos of Stars<br>A captivating novel</h2>
                <p>Egyptian mythology, and family, 
                    from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of And I Darken<br><br>

                    Isadora’s family is seriously screwed up—which comes with the territory when 
                    you’re the human daughter of the Egyptian gods Isis and Osiris.<br><br>
                    
                    Isadora is tired of her immortal relatives and their ancient mythological drama,
                     so when she gets the chance to move to California with her brother, 
                     she jumps on it. But her new life comes with plenty of its own dramatic—and 
                     dangerous—complications . . .</p>

                        <p>Prologue <br><br>
 
                            When I was a little girl, I still believed I was part of the world’s secret 
                            magic.<br> 
                            Mother wrapped her hair elegantly in white cloth. I begged and 
                            pleaded until she did mine as well. At the river, Mother gathered peb- 
                            bles and sand, small plants, sun-bleached bones. I splashed along the 
                            banks, or rode on female hippos if Taweret, my aunt and the goddess 
                            of childbirth, was with us. <br><br>
                            But my favorite place to be, even more than in the brilliant sun 
                            reflecting off the water of the Nile, was with my father. When I was old 
                            enough to navigate the steep, worn steps by myself, I was there every 
                            minute Mother allowed. As soon as I finished my morning worship, 
                            I’d skip straight down. Coloring on the floor next to Father’s knees as 
                            he nodded and watched things I couldn’t see.
                            sketched, planned.  
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page" id="page2">
                        <p> My cat, cranky old Ubesti, came down with me sometimes, though 
                            she much preferred the warm, sunlit stones under the skylights in our 
                            house. One morning when I was barely thirteen, I decided I needed a 
                            live model for her newest portrait on my walls. She was in her usual 
                            spot, mangy fur dull and matted even in the light. I went to pick her 
                            up, expecting a yowl of protest, but was met instead with a limp, 
                            lifeless body. <br><br>
                            My mother immediately knew something was wrong and came into 
                            the room to find me crying. She consoled me with a hug that soothed 
                            my hiccupping sobs, and a kiss that made my head stop hurting from 
                            the tears.
                            “Don’t worry, Little Heart,” she said. “How would you like Ubesti 
                            to be yours forever?”
                         </p>

                <div class="page-pair" id="pair2">
                    <div class="page" id="page3">
                        <p>I nodded, desperate. I’d seen my mother heal sick locals, wit- 
                            nessed her save a baby others had given up for dead. She was magic. 
                            Surely bringing my elderly cat back from death would be no
                            problem—after all, she’d resurrected my father. Death was not a bar- 
                            rier for Isis. <br><br>
                            She took Ubesti’s body from my arms and told me to meet her 
                            downstairs in my room. I nearly tripped in my haste to get there, pac- 
                            ing with nervous excitement. Even after all the potions and amulets I’d 
                            helped her with, she’d never done actual spells for me, and at that 
                            moment I loved her even more than I knew possible.<br>
                            My father came in, smiling his soft, distant smile, and my mother 
                            followed him</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page" id="page4">
                        <p> beaming and carrying a large jar in her hands. It was 
                            carved with glyphs, the lid shaped like a cat’s head, all made in 
                            precious alabaster.<br><br> 
                            “What’s that?” I asked, eager to see what resurrection required. 
                            “This is the vessel that will carry Ubesti to the other side, where 
                            she will wait for you.” Osiris nodded solemnly as my mother handed 
                            him the jar and he placed it on the large block of stone that I used as a 
                            table in the middle of the room.<br> 
                            “Wait—other side? What other side?” <br>
                            “The afterlife,” my father said, looking at me with pride in his eyes. 
                            “I am pleased you chose her as a companion for your journey through 
                            death.”</p>

                <div class="page-pair" id="pair3">
                    <div class="page" id="page5">
                        <p>I staggered back, staring in horror at the jar I now realized con- 
                            tained my cat. “You—she’s not coming back to life?” 
                            “No, Little Heart, not to this life.” <br>
                            The world shifted. My childhood rewrote itself, everything chang- 
                            ing as I realized what this room was, what the person-sized, rectan- 
                            gular stone box was. “This is a tomb. This is my tomb.” I could barely 
                            see my parents through my tears, but their smiles hadn’t changed. 
                            “Of course,” my mother said.<br><br> 
                            “I’m going to die?” <br>
                            “Everything dies.” My mother took a few steps toward me, but I 
                            held up my hands, blocking her. 
                            “You don’t die! He doesn’t die!” <br>
                            “No, Little Heart, but you—” <br>
                            “You’re going to just let me die? And put me in there, all by myself, 
                            forever?”</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page" id="page6">
                        <p>“You’re going to just let me die? And put me in there, all by myself, 
                            forever?” <br>
                            “You won’t be alone. You’ll be with your father and all your broth- 
                            ers and sisters who have gone before you.” <br>
                            “But I won’t be here!” <br>
                            “No.” <br>
                            “You don’t care? That doesn’t make you sad? You’re not going to
                            do anything to stop it?” <br>
                            Finally my mother caught on, and her expression softened. “Oh, 
                            Isadora, when you understand—” 
                            I ran out of that horrible room. For the first time in my life I did 
                            understand. All of the stories, the histories I’d been raised on? I had 
                            no part in them.</p>

                            in the sand—impermanent and fragile and gone in a breath of wind.
