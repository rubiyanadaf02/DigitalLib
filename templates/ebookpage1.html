                            She pulled the burlap from her head and gasped for air. It took time 
                            for her eyes to adjust while amorphous shapes danced in her vision 
                            and the blackness faded. She listened for his presence but all she 
                            heard was the splattering rain outside. Dropping the burlap bag to the 
                            ground, she tiptoed to the bunker door. Surprised to see it opened a 
                            crack, she put her face to the crevice between the door and the frame 
                            and looked out into the dark forest as rain pelted the trees.<br> She imag- 
                            ined a camera lens trained tightly on her eyeball as she peered 
                            through the splinter in the door, then the 
                            bunker, and eventually a satellite view of the entire for- 
                            est.

                        <p>there was the chance he would be 
                            waiting for her. But if the open door and the moment free from her 
                            shackle were an oversight, it was his first misstep and the only oppor- 
                            tunity she’d had in the last two weeks. This was the first moment she 
                            found herself untethered from the wall of her cellar.<br> <br>
                            With her hands trembling and still bound in front of her, she 
                            pushed open the door.  <br><br>The 
                            hours of darkness from the cellar came back to her and flashed in her 
                            mind like a lightning storm. So, too, did the promise she made to her- 
                            self that if an opportunity for escape appeared, she’d take it. <br><br>
                            She took a hesitant step out of the bunker. She took a moment to 
                            bathe in the downpour, to let the water clear the fogginess from her 
                            mind.</p>

                            self up again. <br>She had counted the days and thought she’d been miss- 
                            ing for twelve. Maybe thirteen. Stuck in a dark cellar where her captor 
                            stowed her and fed her, she may have missed a day when fatigue sent 
                            her into a long stretch of sleep. Tonight, he moved her to the forest. 
                           <br> 
                           <br>
                            She ran blindly, taking erratic turns that stole from her all sense of 
                            direction. Finally, she heard the roar of a semi truck as its wheels 
                            splashed through the wet pavement. <br>
                            <br>
                            She stumbled into the middle of the road and on wobbly legs 
                            chased the lights as though she might catch them. The rain pelted her 
                            face and matted her hair and drenched her ratty clothing. Barefoot, 
                            she continued in a push-slap, push-slap gait brought on by the deep</p>

                            forest—which trickled a crooked line of blood behind her that the 
                            storm worked to erase. <br> Driven by panic that he would come from the 
                            forest, she willed herself on with the sensation that he was near, ready 
                            to fast-step behind her and pull the sack over her head and bring her 
                            back to the cellar with no windows.  <br>
                            A tiny white light far off in the distance. She stag-

                            stayed in the middle of the road and waved her bound hands over her 
                            head.<br><br>

                            door opened. “Are you okay?” the man yelled over the roar of the 
                            storm.  <br><br>
                            “I need help,” she said.

                            The man walked closer, recognized her. “Good God.<br> The whole 
                            state’s been looking for you.” He took her under his arm and led her 
                            to the car, carefully seating her in the front passenger seat. 
                            “Go!” she said. “He’s coming, I know it.”<br> <br>
                            The man raced around to the other side, shifting the car into drive 
                            before his door was closed. He dialed 911 as he sped along Highway

                            “Where’s your friend?” he asked.<br>

                            dabbed her nose with a powdered brush, and general chaos occurred 
                            around her as producers shouted orders and lighting changes and the 
                            time remaining in commercial break. The shoulder shrugs and the <br><br>
                            deep breaths had done nothing useful, and had actually caused a knot 
                            to form in her trapezius, which was starting to spasm. Megan startled, 
                            a quick flinch, when a different makeup artist touched her cheek with a 
                            brush.<br>

                            Megan stuffed her shaking hands under her thighs. Dante Campbell

                            dence perfected by morning-show hosts, among which her show was 
                            the top rated.<br> 
                            “We all know the harrowing story of Megan McDonald. The all- 
                            American girl, daughter of Emerson Bay’s sheriff, who was abducted 
                            in the summer of 2016. One year later, Megan is out now with her 
                            book, Missing, the true-story account of her abduction and coura- 
                            geous escape.” Dante Campbell pulled her gaze from the camera and 
                            smiled at her guest. “Megan, welcome to the show.” <br> 
                            Megan took a hard swallow of dry nothingness that nearly made her 
                            choke. “Thank you,” she said.<br>  <br>
                            “The country and, of course,  What inspired you to finally share it?”</p>

                    <div class="page" id="page8">
                        <p>“It was just time,” Megan said, deciding finally on the answers that 
                            would best get her out of the bright lights.<br> “I needed to process every- 
                            thing before I was ready to tell people about it. I’ve had a chance to do 
                            that, and now I’m ready to tell my story.”<br> 
                            “Time to process and to heal, I’m sure,”<br> Dante Campbell added. 
                            Of course, Megan thought. Because, after all, it had been a whole 
                            year, and certainly such a time frame was sufficient to heal.<br> Surely, a 
                            full year would make her complete again. Because, if Megan didn’t 
                            come across as healed and happy and recovered, Dante Campbell— 
                            queen of morning television—would look wicked while drilling her for 
                            details.<br><br>
                            “That too, yes,” Megan said. <br>
                            “I’m sure something like this takes a long time to get over, and in 
                            some ways documenting the events in your book was therapeutic.”</p>

                        <p>“It was.” Megan smiled with her lips pressed together. <br> It was her 
                            new smile, the best she could do and so different from the beaming 
                            pictures she saw the other day when she paged through her senior 
                            yearbook. Back then, her smile was wide, with straight,<br>  <br>bright teeth 
                            filling the space between her curved lips. She tried at first, but it was 
                            too hard to fake that big smile so she came up with this new one. Lips 
                            together, edges turned up. Happy. People were buying it.<br> <br>
                            “What can people expect from reading your book?”  <br>
                            Megan wasn’t completely sure, since she hadn’t written much of 
                            it—that distinction went to her shrink, who snagged a byline on the 
                            cover.  <br><br>
                            “Yes. And the two weeks I spent in captivity. About where I was kept, 
                            and all my failed attempts to get away. And then about the night I, you 
                            know, ran out of the forest.”  <br>
                            “The night you escaped.”</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page" id="page10">
                        <p>Dante Campbell also smiled. Her voice was soft. “The man who 
                            found you on Highway Fifty-Seven.”  <br>
                            “Yes. He’s my hero. My dad’s hero, too.”  <br>
                            “I bet. We had Mr. Steinman on the show, not long after your or- 
                            deal.”  <br>
                            “It’s no secret the country has fallen in love with you. So many people 
                            want to know how you’re doing and what’s next for you. Will they get 
                            any of that from the book? About your plans for the future?” 
                            Megan pulled her hand from under her thigh and rotated it in the 
                            air to help her think. “There’s a lot about what’s happened since that 
                            night, yes.”  <br><br>
                            “With you and your family?” 
                            “And with the ongoing investigation?”  <br>
                            “As much as we know about it, yes.”</p>
