                    <h3>England vs Scotland the first battle</h3>
                    <p>The red brick Roman walls of Carlisle loomed high over Cuthbert.
                        The bishop of Lindisfarne had only arrived the day before, 
                        after a long and weary journey, and already his worthy hosts
                        insisted that he come to see a fountain, built by the long-gone
                        Romans and set into the city wall, that still flung water into the air.
                        "Bishop Cuthbert, this way," said one. "The Roman fountain is just here."
                        But as he turned to look at it, Cuthbert went pale. 
                        As if on the verge of fainting, he grabbed his staff and leant on it.

                    <h3>1918 The spring offensive part-1</h3>
                    <p>On 20 March 1918 general Marie-Emile fayolle,who was to lead the Allied reserves that engaged
                      and halted 'Operation Michael',the first strike of the German 1918 Spring Offensive, noted in his diary,
                      "More and more it seems to be confirmed that the Boche will not attack".In their shattering offensive that
                      commenced the next morning,General Erich Ludendorff's armies would secure that battlefield victory-surprise.<br>
                      Several other factors facilitated their early success.First,it was a matter of scale; an attack with 74 infantry
                      divisions  along an 80-kilometer(50-mile) front was the largest seen on the Western Front since the battles of 1914.

                    <p>After'Operation Michael'was halted in front of Amiens in early April 1918,General Erich Ludendorff would continue to
                      rain blows on the Allied lines - four in all between April and mid-July.The first of these.'Operation Generation',struck 
                      against the British Second and Frist Armies to the south of Ypres salient on 9 April,pushing back but not breaking the line 
                      around that symbolic town.'Operation Blucher',which commenced on 27 may,overwhelmed Allied forces on the Chemin des Dames and 
                       saw German troops reaching the River marne,which they had last crossed in 1914,before they were halted on its banks.</p>
