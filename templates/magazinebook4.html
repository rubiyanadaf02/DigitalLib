                    <p>In 2023 the Republic of Fiji introduced two new holidays: Girmit Day and Ratu Sir
                        Lala Sukuna Day. The latter honours the life and accomplishments of Ratu Sir
                        Lala Sukuna (1888-1958), an influential iTaukei (Indigenous Fijian) chief 
                        who achieved major land reforms under the British colonial administration.
                        The former refers to the indenture agreements, known as girmits, that between 
                        the years 1879 and 1916 bound 60,965 people from India, who became known as Girmitiyas,
                        to five years of violence and coerced labour in Fiji's colonial sugarcane fields.
                        Girmit Day and Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna Day reference important people and events in Fiji's
                        colonial past, a past that-due to intense foreign interest in Fiji-intersected with 
                        global histories of British imperialism, multinational trade, and plantation agriculture.

                    <h3>Decolonizing the culture</h3>
                    <p>If history is written by the victors, then there comes a point in society when the victims
                        themselves begin to write their own history. You may not like it, and it may make you uncomfortable,
                        but it is our truth nonetheless.
                        May 14, 1879, marks the first day Indians landed on the shores of Fiji. As a result,
                        Girmit Day, as this day is known, is celebrated yearly in Fiji and throughout the diaspora. 
                        Every year, crowds of people celebrate girmit and the first arrival of Indians to Fiji.
                        But when viewed through the lens of decolonization and reconciliation, one must ask, 
                        "What is is a derivative of the word, the indentured labour agreement.</p>

                    <h3>After the Rain</h3>
                    <p>After the rain the grass will shed its moisture, the fog will lift from the trees,
                        a new light will brighten the sky.
                        ~Chief Dan George (Tsleil Waututh)
                        Before beginning a teaching, we are asked to prepare ourselves, clear our minds,
                        and prepare to listen. As an oral culture, the old people, for our cultural and 
                        spiritual safety, repeated their stories until in their hearts they knew we were prepared.
                        You will find repetition here. My grandfather, Adam Jimmy, always said to our mother,
                        Kay George, especially after she got out of Kuper Island Indian Residential School, 
                        "Did you hear what I said? Tell me what I just said." She did the same thing to her 
                        children when we were growing up.

                    <h3>Refracting history</h3>
                    <p>The fire which destroyed most of the village of Lytton on June 30, 2021, is an event British 
                        Columbians will not soon forget, a disaster that will likely be studied by historians of the 
                        future. Poetry can offer a means to capture the human experience during historical events, 
                        and Burning Sage, the debut collection from Lytton poet Meghan Fandrich, does just that.
                        Living just outside of town, Fandrich's home was spared, but she lost her downtown business.
                        Born out of a need to process and then share her emotional response to the fire that shattered 
                        her life and her community, Fandrich's poems are raw, vulnerable, and honest. </p>
