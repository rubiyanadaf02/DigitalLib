                            Darby Thorne was six miles up Backbone Pass when her windshield 
                            wiper broke, and that bass-baritone voice was just kicking into the 
                            second chorus. It was official: he’d be getting his white Christmas. He 
                            could shut up about it now.<br><br>  
                            She thumbed the radio dial (nothing else but static) and watched 
                            her left wiper blade flap like a fractured wrist. She considered pulling 
                            over to duct-tape it, but there was no highway shoulder—just walled 
                            embankments of dirty ice crowding her right and left. She was afraid 
                            to stop anyway.
                            </p>

                    <div class="page" id="page2">
                        <p>The snowflakes had been big and soppy when she’d 
                            blown through Gold Bar forty minutes ago, but they’d grown smaller 
                            and grittier as her altitude climbed.<br><br> They were hypnotic now in her rac- 
                            ing headlights, a windshield of stars smearing into light speed. 
                            chains mandatory, the last sign she’d seen had warned.<br> 
                            Darby didn’t own snow chains. Not yet, at least. This was her 
                            sophomore year at CU-Boulder and she’d never planned on venturing 
                            any farther off campus than Ralphie’s Thriftway. <br><br>
                            She rememberedwalking back from there last month, half-drunk with a gaggle of half 
                            friends from her dorm, and when one of them asked her (only half 
                            giving a shit) where she planned to go for Christmas break, Darby had 
                            answered bluntly that it would require an act of God himself to make 
                            her come back home to Utah.

                        <p>And apparently he’d been listening, because he’d blessed Darby’s 
                            mother with late-stage pancreatic cancer. 
                            She’d learned this yesterday. 
                            Via text message.<br><br> 
                            Scrape-scrape. The bent wiper blade slapped the glass again, but the 
                            snowflakes were dry enough, and the car’s speed fast enough, that the 
                            windshield stayed clear. <br>The real problem was the accumulating snow 
                            on the road. The yellow lane markers were already hidden by several 
                            inches of fresh white, and periodically Darby felt her Honda Civic’s 
                            chassis rake the surface.<br><br> The sound returned like a wet cough, a little 
                            worse every time. On the last one, she’d felt the steering wheel vibrate 
                            between her knuckled fingers. Another inch of powder and she’d be 
                            stranded up here, nine thousand feet above sea level with a quarter 
                            tank of gas, no cell coverage, and only her troubled thoughts for com- 
                            pany.</p>

                        <p>And the brassy voice of Bing Crosby, she supposed. He crooned 
                            the final chorus as Darby took a sip of warm Red Bull. 
                            Scrape-scrape. <br><br>
                            The entire drive had been like this—a blurry, bloodshot charge 
                            through miles of foothills and scrub plains. No time to stop. All she’d 
                            eaten today was ibuprofen. She’d left her desk lamp on in her dorm 
                            room, but she’d only noticed this as she left the Dryden parking lot— 
                            too far to turn back. <br><br>Stomach acid in her throat. Pirated Schoolyard 
                            Heroes and My Chemical Romance tracks looping on her (now dead) 
                            iPod Touch. Racing green signboards with faded fast food decals.<br> 
                            Boulder had vanished in her rearview mirror around 3:00 p.m., and 
                            then the foggy skyline of Denver with its fleet of grounded jets, and fi-

                            cued up. She’d heard them all twice now.<br><br> 
                            Her Honda bucked sharply left. Red Bull splashed in her lap. The 
                            steering wheel went rigid in her grip and she fought it for a stomach- 
                            fluttery second (turn into the skid, turn into the skid) before twisting the 
                            vehicle back under control, still moving forward and uphill—but
                            losing speed. Losing traction. <br><br>
                            “No, no, no.” She pumped the gas.<br> 
                            The all-weather tires gripped and released in the sludgy snow, heav- 
                            ing the car in violent contractions. Steam sizzled off the hood. 
                            “Come on, Blue—”

                            tion. Twin spurts of snow kicked up in her rearview mirror, lit vivid red 
                            by her taillights. <br> <br> A harsh rattling sound—Blue’s undercarriage 
                            scraping the snow’s surface again. The car struggled and fishtailed, 
                            half boat now, and— <br> <br> 
                            Scrape— <br> 
                            The left wiper blade snapped off and twirled away.

                            into tunnel vision, and she punched her steering wheel. The horn

                            Now it was just a gray lantern slipping behind jagged peaks, and the 
                            sky was dimming to a bruised purple.<br><br> Frozen fir trees becoming

                            right. It crept up on her, catching the glow of her Honda’s dirty head- 
                            lights in a flash: 365 days since the last fatal accident.
