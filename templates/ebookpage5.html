                            Dear Mama, <br>
                            I am most certainly not dead. Thank you for your tender concern. I 
                            will try to write more often so you don’t have to worry so between let- 
                            ters. (Because a week’s silence surely means I have fallen prey to a 
                            wasting illness or been murdered in these boring, gray streets.) 
                            School is going well. <br>I am excelling in all of my classes. (Appar- 
                            ently, some things never change, and girls are not challenged in 
                            Albion in the same way they weren’t on Melei.) My professors are all 
                            intelligent and kind. (Kind of horrible.) None stand out. (I refuse to 
                            mention him by name, no matter how many obviously “subtle”
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page" id="page2">
                        <p>questions you ask.) <br>The other students are also quite focused on their 
                            schooling, and none of us has much time for socializing. Boys and girls 
                            attend separate classes as well, so no, I have not met many interesting 
                            young men. (I am neither courting nor being courted. Please stop 
                            hoping.)<br> 
                            Tell Aunt Li’ne thank you for the mittens. They are very much 
                            appreciated in this cold, damp climate I am so unused to. And please 
                            tell the sun hello and I miss her very much! I also miss you, of course. 
                            (I do. Very much.) 
                            All my love, 
                            Jessamin

                        <p>Reading over the letter to my mother,<br> I am so absorbed in my 
                            head with adding the true statements to my written words that I fail to 
                            pay attention to the street. <br>I cannot decide which shocks me more— 
                            nearly being run over by the horse-drawn cart, or the fluid stream of 
                            cursing in my native tongue that is being directed at me.<br><br> 
                            I look up, cheeks burning, and meet a pair of black eyes that, com- 
                            bined with the familiarity of the language, hit me with a longing for 
                            Melei so deep and painful I can scarcely draw a breath.
                            The man pauses, obviously surprised to see how dark of skin and 
                            eyes I am in spite of my school uniform.</p>

                        <p>  And so I take the opportunity 
                            to insult his manhood, his lineage, and his horse in a single, well- 
                            crafted turn of phrase I haven’t used since my friend Kelen taught it to 
                            me when I was fourteen. 
                            He smiles. <br><br>
                            I smile back.<br> 
                            Brushing his hand through the air in another gesture so achingly 
                            familiar it brings tears to my eyes, he clicks his tongue and the cart 
                            moves on, our near-collision forgotten. <br>
                            He’s made me crave heat. The sun’s anemic rays pull more 
                            warmth from me than they offer. I hate Albion, the whole gray country. 
                            I hate Avebury, a city just as gray, teeming with people but coldly life- 
                            less.</p>

                        <p>No. Homesickness does me no good. Wiping under my eyes, I 
                            straighten my shoulders and march toward the hotel. I only have a 
                            couple of hours before my shift to do my reading for tomorrow’s 
                            classes, and I will not be anything less than the best. I cannot afford it. 
                            I cut away from the main thoroughfare and find myself in a narrow 
                            alley. It’s old, the lines not quite vertical as they lean ever so gradually
                            overhead.<br><br> 
                            “What’s wrong, chickie bird?” 
                            I startle, my eyes whipped down from where they traced the line of 
                            the sky. A man with the thick build, intricate tattoos, and accom- 
                            panying ripe scent of a dockworker stands directly in front of me.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page" id="page6">
                        <p>“Nothing.” I flash a tight, dismissive smile honed these last few 
                            months of learning to blend in. “Just passing through.”<br> 
                            “Nah, don’t do that.” He steps to the side as I do, and his mass 
                            blocks me from walking by. “Come have a drink with me, yeah? Make 
                            you feel all better.” <br>
                            “I have somewhere to be.” <br><br>
                            His smile broadens, blue eyes nearly lost in the tanned squint 
                            lines of his face. “You ain’t from ’round here, are you? An island rat, 
                            that’s what you are.” He reaches out with a meaty hand to touch my 
                            hair, black as night and waterfall straight, where I have it pulled into a 
                            bun at the base of my neck.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="page-pair" id="pair4">
                    <div class="page" id="page7">
                        <p>“Excuse me.” I back up but he follows, leaning in closer. “Let me 
                            by.” <br>
                            “I’ve heard stories about island rats. You can tell me if they’re 
                            true.”<br>
                            I lift onto my toes to sprint away when a hand comes down on my 
                            shoulder. 
                            “There you are, darling. So sorry I’m late.” <br>
                            I don’t know this voice, a low tenor with the clipped, stylish vowels 
                            of the classes I only see when delivering orders to their expensive 
                            hotel rooms.<br><br> 
                            I stiffen under his fingers, which are light but steady on my shoul- 
                            der. Now there are two of them to deal with. I slide my hand into my 
                            satchel, gripping the handle of the paring knife I borrowed from the 
                            kitchen and keep with me all the time. The gentleman’s fingers 
                            tighten. <br>
                            “Not necessary,” he whispers. 
                            I turn to look at him—a low, round hat is pulled over his forehead, 
                            obscuring his eyes. His lips are sly and twisted into a smile over teeth 
                            far finer than my dockworker friend’s. This man is a porcelain doll 
                            compared to the brute blocking my path. He’s taller than me but lean, 
                            all angles in his suit that reeks of money. 
                            Apparently, the dockworker has the same assessment. “This your 
                            girl? I don’t think she is.</p>
