                Porsche did exactly this in 1986,instigating the 944 Turbo Cup series,
                which kicked-off in Germany.The championship piggybacked off the ADAC

                Hockenheimring,the Norising at Nuremburg plus a one-off race at Mainz

                    <p>The 944 enjoyed success as blistering as its stills. After the release of the 
                    the S2 in 1989,factory bosses made plans to develop the model even further.
                    The next-gen 944 wasset to wear the S3 designations,but so extensive were the proposed
                     changes,it became clear the resulting car would be more or less an entirely new Porsche.
                    with the more or less an entirely new porsche.<br>With this in mind,
                    the decision was made to forge ahead with a path that followed the chosen route,
                    but ended with a fresh model. Adopting its development programme codename,the 968 was bron.</p>

                    <p>The proud owner of a recently restored 1986 944 Turbo,and being a big fan of 
                     of the models in Porsche's transaxle family of products,the opportunity of the 
                     thirtieth anniversary of the 968 - pitched as "the next evolution" in the manufacturer's
                    period marketing materials,but actually being the evolutionina in a line of four-cylinder,front-
                    engined, water-cooled Porsche sports cars starting with the 924 in the mid-1970s-
                    filled me with exitement.<br>In truth,any opportunity to shout about the merits of this largely 
                    unheared-of Stuttgart speed machine is good enough,but it's greate to have been able to pull together 
                    a comprehensive look at the different flavours of 968.</p>

                    <p>When we were compiling our list 2022's best buys with specific price points in mind and,
                    subsequently,when we attempted to reduce the number of selected Porsches into a managable number 
                    corrsponding to the available column inches this magazine has to offer,one model refused to be dismissed.<br>
                    The 968 Sport.It's a modern classic we've raved avout in recent issues of 911 & Porsche World and,
                    with the 968's thirthiet anniversary celebrations now coming to a close,we considered this buying themed 
                    issue of the magazine the perfect forum to round out our own honouring of this brilliant sports car.</p>

                    <p>If you've been around enthusiastowned vehicles long enough,you'll have heard someone say "cars find me"
                    when describing how they've come by the fourwheeler(s) on their driveway.it's easy to dismiss such a claim,
                   but I'm living proof it holds true - though I actively went on the hunt for a Turbo found me,so to speak.<br>
                 This is the most recent addition to furr's Fleet,which now stand at fifteen cars spanning a wide variety of makes 
                 and models,from a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow II to an exwor British Touring Vauxhall cavalier GSi.As was the case with my
                 968 when it came to buying most of the cars I own,I searched high and low until i found what i was looking for.
                 in contrast,the 968 arrived at my door unannounced.I'm not talking figuratively.</p>
